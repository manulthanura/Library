# library

Welcome to my Library!

Libraries in programming languages are collections of prewritten code that users can use to optimize tasks.

Programming libraries are valuable tools that can make a developer’s job more efficient. They provide pre-written, reusable chunks of code that developers can use to create applications quickly and easily. 

Imagine you’re creating an application that allows people to purchase and participate in a course. You might turn to a free, open-source library to create user authentication for logging in. Or you could use a library to connect your app to a server.
